This page lists _front-end_ software that can operate in a Monto-based
development environment.
Front-ends usually provide multiple components in the Monto architecture,
acting as both sources and sinks.
They provide an integrated experience of the sources and sinks so that
a user can integrate Monto-based facilities into their normal workflow.
