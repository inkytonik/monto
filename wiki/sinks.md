This page lists sinks and related code that can operate in a Monto-based
development environment.
Sinks consume products from Monto servers and (usually) display information
in a useful way to the user, possibly via an integrated
[frontend](https://bitbucket.org/inkytonik/monto/src/default/wiki/frontends.md).

PyJSMonto
---------

The [PyJSMonto sink](https://bitbucket.org/scottbuckley/pyjsmonto) sits
between Monto and a Web browser.
It provides viewing of HTML products as well as more complex visualisations
of trees and graphs.
